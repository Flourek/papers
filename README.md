This is a [Papers, Please](https://papersplea.se/) twitch integration mod for the
[Unity C# / IL2CPP version](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/239030/view/3651894293966905793)
of the game, made for [PSP1G](https://www.twitch.tv/psp1g) 

It integrates [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) chat with the game, and randomly selects a random chatter for each traveller.

If they get denied, shot, or detained at the border, they get banned in chat.
